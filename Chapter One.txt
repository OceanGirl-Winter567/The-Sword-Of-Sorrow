I've been told the same thing over and over again *don't be rude, don't upset anyone, use your manners, be polite, and the one golden rule we all know: treat others the way you want to be treated*. But have you ever thought about those sayings, those what they call "rules"? I know I have and let's say there is a deeper meaning to it, maybe a hidden truth, or maybe a hidden sorrow and more control of us. How do I know? I just know...
  This is Raven speaking and yes I have thought about it, but don't worry I was just joking we all know those rules matter and we all know what happens as soon as we stop following them. But I do think we should get to know eachother first. You already know my name so I don't need to say that again.
  I'm currently 13 years old and I have an older sis who's name is Circe, and if you know a lot about greek mythology I'm sure your thinking of the goddess right now. That's honestly pretty accurate because she's amazing; mainly because she is a very overproctive person and I love it when she gets like that; it makes me feel special. I also have a friend who I hangout with every single day until I really have to come home.
  "Rave! Get over here!"
  Thats Circe calling me and she sounds angery right now I'm scared.
  "I'm coming chill"
  "I swear if you tell me to chill I will throw this danm thing right at you like a bowling pin!"
  "ok ok sorry"
  "thats it"
  Ow! That accually kind of hurt; at least I wasn't on the stairs when it hit me.
  "what is it that your so pissed about that you had to throw the notebook at me?"
  I know why she's mad; I drew little devil faces all over her dairy, underlined and highlighted all of the spicy stuff that was in there (there was a whole lot of jucy gossip and I found out her crush. I'm going to tell him tomorrow), and I even put stars all over the good stuff I found in there. In my opinion: she needs to get a better lock on that thing; maybe a key or something I don't know.
  "look what you did in there and explain otherwise I'll swing you down the stairs and into the garbage can!"
  She did it anyways. It hurt a lot; I hate how she always goes to throwing me in the garbege can and sometime even outside into the neighbors window, but I'm pretty sure every set of siblings do that to eachother right? Did I forget to mention she doesn't only get overprotective over me, but she also gets over protective over herself. I don't see how that makes sense but that what I've seen lots and lots of times. I still care about her; not love her I meant care about her.

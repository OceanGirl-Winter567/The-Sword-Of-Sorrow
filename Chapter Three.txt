Enough about that now I think I've said to much sorry I tend to get a little to exited about my room. On to other stuff even though I don't know what to talk about. Oh I know! Let's do another prank on my sis. I'm going to take one her crytals and hide it somwhere in my room, and the crystal is going to be a really special one that she has had almost all her life. She has a lot though so its going to be hard to pick. I'm thinking of the sappphire she has but there is also an emerald too. I'm sure which ever one goes missing from her window will be a good one though.

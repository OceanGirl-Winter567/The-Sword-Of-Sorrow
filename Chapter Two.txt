My mom is whole different story though. She's told me that she *wasn't normal* whatever that's suppost to mean. It keeps me up at night most of the time; just wondering and wondering what she means by that. I've wrote it down many times in my diary, which I have a better lock on mine then Circe does on her's (hehe)
  "HEY! BOTH OF YOU NEED TO GET DOWN HERE NOW NO MATTER WHAT YOUR DOING!"
  "Danm, looks like mom's mad again"
  "for once I agree with you Rave"
  My mom is always mad at something weather it's the music being just a little to loud or something that she heard on the news about lawyers and stuff, but it doesn't matter what any of us are doing because when she's mad, she's mad. I remeber she even picked me up from school in the middle of a state testing session just because she was mad at something and needed to take it out on someone. She had a little fight going on that day, and I mean a physical one. The whole went on lockdown and didn't even know why because we didn't hear any shooting surprisingly. That's just one of the many things that she's done to prove that she's a phycopath.
  "what the hell is all the screaming and smashing all about and let me warn you if I hear something stupid I will throw you out of this house for a while and maybe even for good if you push your luck"
  We told her the truth, well at least I did, but I'm not sure if Circe did because we got kicked out for a while. Circe has a really cool apartment that we always go to whenever we get thrown out like that and mom doesn't even know about it.
  "so how much longer is this going to go miss emo queen?"
  "I don't know but I'm pretty sure were gonna be kicked out for good one day. If that happens then we can just live in my place for good miss emo princess"
  "stop calling me princess what am I five?"
  "you keep on calling a queen so I'm just trying to keep it fair over here"
  "ok ok but can we go to Hot Topic?"
  "sure but only 2 graphic tees"
  We spent two freaking hours there and we totally forgot about the 2 graphic tee rule. Instead we got our money's worth, and I swear we bought up the whole store. We drove back to my sister's apartment where I had my own room there two because of how often we would get kicked out by my mom. I think she does it in blind rages though because she never notictes when we come back; she would think we've been there the whole time. I don't know weather she it aware of what she does or not, but either way we don't really care.
  Another thing we tend to do is blast our favortie bands in the car such as: My Chemical Romance, The Lost Causes, The World Of Failiures, and lots more too. We both love emo music and that's what made us fully emo. Well, I kind of took the scene side, but it was only because I really love those braclets they wear; Circe took the truly emo side though. The only colors I see her wearing most of the time are black, white, and red. The only time she wears anything else is on Halloween when she ends up being something like Medusa or something that gives off that type of vibe. Sometimes I think she's always dressed up for Halloween, but I would never say that because that is exacly what everyone tells us; mostly Circe but I still get told that a lot too. 
  Were here now and Circe's apartment, and her place is not your typical apartment. It has LED lights everywhere, the whole house is filled up with spooky decorations like skulls, her minie fridge is filled with mosters and red bulls the only good energy drinks, and that's just her living room and her kitchen; her and my room are our dreams. My room is so full of band and album posters its flooding my walls. I have fake spider webbs on the corners of my room. The bed frame is a frame with a book shelf and two nightstands attached to it, LED lights glowing from the bottem, and its covered in stickers that have been building up on the bed for a few years now and their mostly band stickers. I love music ok? Don't juge me.

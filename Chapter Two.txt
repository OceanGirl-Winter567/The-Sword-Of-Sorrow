My mom is whole different story though. She's told me that she *wasn't normal* whatever that's suppost to mean. It keeps me up at night most of the time; just wondering and wondering what she means by that. I've wrote it down many times in my diary, which I have a better lock on mine then Circe does on her's (hehe)
  "HEY! BOTH OF YOU NEED TO GET DOWN HERE NOW NO MATTER WHAT YOUR DOING!"
  "Danm, looks like mom's mad again"
  "for once I agree with you Rave"
  My mom is always mad at something weather it's the music being just a little to loud or something that she heard on the news about lawyers and stuff, but it doesn't matter what any of us are doing because when she's mad, she's mad. I remeber she even picked me up from school in the middle of a state testing session just because she was mad at something and needed to take it out on someone. She had a little fight going on that day, and I mean a physical one. The whole went on lockdown and didn't even know why because we didn't hear any shooting surprisingly. That's just one of the many things that she's done to prove that she's a phycopath.
  "what the hell is all the screaming and smashing all about and let me warn you if I hear something stupid I will throw you out of this house for a while and maybe even for good if you push your luck"
  We told her the truth, well at least I did, but I'm not sure if Circe did because we got kicked out for a while. Circe has a really cool apartment that we always go to whenever we get thrown out like that and mom doesn't even know about it.
  "so how much longer is this going to go miss emo queen?"
  "I don't know but I'm pretty sure were gonna be kicked out for good one day. If that happens then we can just live in my place for good miss emo princess"
  "stop calling me princess what am I five?"
  "you keep on calling a queen so I'm just trying to keep it fair over here"
  "ok ok but can we go to Spencers and Hot Topic?"
  "sure but only 2 graphic tees"
  We spent two freaking hours there and we totally forgot about the 2 graphic tee rule. Instead we got our money's worth, and I swear we bought up the whole store.
